	<h1>Projects</h1>
	<p>
		Here lies the programming projects I have completed throughout my journey in computer science!
		Note: For some of these projects you must download the projects development framework to run it.
		All frameworks used are open sourced and well documented.
	</p>

		<h1>Agario</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Agario.png">
		<p>
			This project emulates the game Agar.io, where little blobs move around and consume other 
			blobs that are smaller than them. This project utilizes "seeking" which uses the
			manipulation of vectors for one object to seek out or follow a target.

		<h1>Apple Shoot</h1>
		<img src="Assets/AppleShoot.png">
		<p>
			This project is a little game where the player shoots an apple with an arrow. Each time
			you shoot the apple the timer increases. Shoot as many apples as you can before the time
			runs out!

		<h1>Asteroids</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Asteroids.png">
		<p>
			This project emulates the game Asteroids, where a player defends themself against
			waves of incoming asteroids. Shoot the asteroids to gain points, survive! There were
			some cool OOP/polymorphism techniques learned in this project. I still need to refactor
			the collision detection with the player and asteroids so that it's not just circles as hit
			boxes but instead (more accurately) line collisions.

		<h1>Collisions</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Collisions.png">
		<p>
			Bellow is a few projects that are to do with colliding objects. I learned a lot of math in these
			projects that I didn't think I would need. Flipping the y direction on a window is also annoying
			as compared to a normal cartesian plane. Circle on circle collsions was fairly simple, rectangle
			on rectangle was a little difficult and circle on rectangle took a bit to get.

		<h1>Fireworks</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Fireworks.png">
		<p>
			This was a really cool project to learn about particle systems. Really cool result! Can't 
			stop looking...

		<h1>Fourier Drawings</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Fourier.png">
		<p>
			This was a simple project where I just threw some circles together and watched what they
			drew with different radii and periods. Turns out some dude already did this a long time ago.
			Props to Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier.

		<h1>Fractal</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Fractal.png">
		<p>
			Fractals! Probably the coolest thing in this world. What more could you want than recursion
			and drawing cool math stuff? This example is of a fractal tree.

		<h1>Friend</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Friend.png">
		<p>
			This was a very fun project involving random movements and actions from a little dude
			on the screen. It was really fun to draw the little guy in all his different positions.
			If you ever feel lonely and need a buddy, throw this guy on your screen and he'll make
			you feel better :)

		<h1>Galaga</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Galaga.png">
		<p>
			This project emulates the game Galaga, where a player defends against incoming waves of
			aliens. This game was created before I took a proper class on computer science, so the
			code is messy and the actual implementation is really not well done. But I had a really
			fun time making the noises and designing the aliens and player. Maybe make an OF project
			of this in the near future???

	<div>
		<h1>Genetic Algorithm</h1>
		<img src="Assets/GeneticAlgorithm.png">
		<p>
			This project was my first exposure to artificial intelligence. Using the genetic algorithm, little
			players (balls) learn to find a target (another ball). When I first made this project, I was amazed
			that one object could LEARN to find another object just through trial and error. I'm not 100% sure 
			but I think the open frameworks version of this project is just slightly more optimized.

		<h1>Mandelbrot Set</h1>

		<p>
			Mandelbrot set! Pretty cool project. Fun to mess around with and change the parameters.

		<h1>Mine Sweeper</h1>
		<img src="Assets/MineSweeper.png">
		<p>
			I probably learned the most from this project. I learned how to use and create objects
			without even knowing what the term object oriented programming was. Also learning 
			how recursion can be useful when searching in a matrix. Over all very pleased with this 
			project!

		<h1>Phage Fighter</h1>
		<img src="Assets/PhageFighter.jpg">
		<p>
			Little action game that involves upgrades and fighting things! Learned some cool OOP
			things and collision math. Very fun to draw the players and enemies and settings!

		<h1>Ray Tracing</h1>
		<img src="Assets/RayTracing.png">
		<p>
			Ray tracing is so cool! You can make things see and also make cool 3d surroundings and make light!
			I learned a lot about image generation and graphics with these projects.

		<h1>Snake</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Snake.png">
		<p>
			This project was one of my first projects. I learned how to move data in a matrix. 
			Learned a thing or two about vectors before I knew they were vectors. I feel this
			is a pretty basic game and a good place to start!

		<h1>Tetris</h1>
		<img src="Assets/Tetris.png">
		<p>
			My first project! For this project I looked up a youtube video on how to make tetris in JS.
			Much of the code here is not mine, however I did make some of my own stuff like the next
			piece window and the shadow placement. Would not reccomend as a first project to learn CS.
